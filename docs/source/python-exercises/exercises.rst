About Exercises
===============

This chapter provides exercises that align with the *Python* basics and  geospatial chapters. Code templates including *README* files with instructions for the exercises are hosted in external repositories (visit https://github.com/Ecohydraulics and  look for the *Exercise-repositories*).

The exercises guide through practical applications of *Python* programming in water resources management, hydraulic engineering, and  ecohydraulics. The contents of the training include the dimensioning of reservoirs, calculation of flood return periods, simple hydraulic calculations as well as sediment transport estimates and  habitat analyses. Each exercise starts with an explanation of the physical background of the applications.

The following table summarizes the practice application and the coding aspects featured in the exercises on the following pages:

Some exercises have **HOMEWORK** statements at the end. The described *HOMEWORK*\ s should be completed by the following lecture. Generally, every exercise not completed during the lecture should be completed in self-study until the next lecture.

Enjoy a successful and  entertaining learning experience!
